We provide the unique word list form the [IndoWordnet (IWN)](https://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/indowordnet/) knowledge base. The word list for each language in IWN is available in a separate file where each file contains one word per line.

### Bilingual Mappings

These bilingual mappings have been obtained from the [IndoWordnet (IWN)](https://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/indowordnet/) knowledge base, and had been originally released on the [CFILT website](https://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/Downloads.html). For user/developer convenince, we also provide them here.
